Passdb
===================
Yet another password manager.
Small Go CLI-tool that asks for your master password and then decodes a small textfile with encrypted passwords you can easilly share across your computers.

Why create this?
- Got tired of vendor lock-ins and cloud B/S;
- Wanted something simple so I can easily share it between all of my machines;
